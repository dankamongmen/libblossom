libblossom -- extremely parallel thread spawning

libblossom automates the highly parallel spawning of threads. This is
useful on machines with many processing elements, or NUMA machines where
locality among processor subgroups is critical. Either some absolute
number of threads can be spawned, or a number per processing element.
