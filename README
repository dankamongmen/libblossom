libblossom -- extremely parallel thread spawning

Massively parallel programs can incur significant startup overhead due to
the spawning of threads. Libblossom spawns threads, optionally restricting
them to distinct processing elements, in a highly parallel fashion.
Libblossom exports interfaces to create a fixed number of threads, or a
fixed number per processing element.
